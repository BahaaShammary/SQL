1. How to create and delete a database: 
	a. CREATE DATABASE test;
	b. DROP DATABASE test;

2. Creating a database to work with:
	a. CREATE DATABASE Bahaa;

3. Create a table inside that databse: 
	CREATE TABLE customers(  	# creating a table with the row title ‘customers’ 
	id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,   # The column ‘id’ which carries int value and can’t be empty
	first_name VARCHAR(255),  # the first name column w/ varchar is the data type and the maximum length of characters is (255)
	last_name VARCHAR(255),
	email VARCHAR(255), 
	address VARCHAR(255),
	city VARCHAR(255),
	town/state VARCHAR(255),
	zipcode VARCHAR(255),
	PRIMARY KEY(id) # the primary key is unique and we want id to be unique 
	);

4. How to insert data into the table:
    INSERT INTO customers(first_name, last_name, email, address, city, town, zipcode)
    VALUES
    (‘Bahaa’, ‘Shammary’, ‘bshammary@gmail.ie’, ’22 high st’, ‘Cork’, ‘Douglas’, ‘T9A5’),
    (‘Derek’, ‘Williams’, ‘dwilliams@gmail.ie’, ’23 high st’, ‘Limerick’, ‘Abbeyfeale’, ‘T10A5’),
    (‘Michael’, ‘Murph’, ‘m.murph@gmail.ie’, ’24 high st’, ‘Cork’, ‘Douglas, ‘T11A5’),
    (‘Kathy’, ‘Morris’, ‘kathym@gmail.ie’, ’25 high st’, ‘Cork’, ‘Kinsale’, ‘T12A5’);
    (‘Kate’, ‘Murphy’, ‘kmurph@gmail.ie’, ’26 high st’, ‘Kerry’, ‘Tralee’, ‘T13A5’);
    (‘Johnny’, ‘Davidson’, ‘jdavidson@gmail.ie’, ’27 high st’, ‘Kilkenny’, ‘Callan’, ‘T14A5’);
    # first, we declare which column we would like to add the data into, and we declare that
    # only once. then we write the corresponding values we would like inside each of those columns
    
5.	How to update a record (i.e. a customer wanting to change their email address):
    a.	UPDATE customers
    SET email = ‘test@gmail.com’  # the change we want
    WHERE id =3;  		 # to which row it will affect

6.	How to delete an entire row (deleting a customer):
    DELETE FROM customers
    WHERE id = 5;             # here you can delete by id but you can choose other column names

7.	ALTERING A TABLE (i.e. adding a column)
    a.	ALTER TABLE customers ADD COLUMN newColumn VARCHAR(255);
    b.	ALTER TABLE customers ADD COLUMN age INT;  # we will need this later for select

    c.	Changing a column’s data type:
    ALTER TABLE customers
    MODIFY COLUMN newColumn INT(11);  # changing column’s data type from varchar to int 

8.	Deleting a column from a table:
    ALTER TABLE customers
    DROP COLUMN newColumn;

9.	Selecting from a table: 
    SELECT * FROM customers;    # selecting all from the table
    SELECT first_name, last_name FROM customers;    # selecting specific columns from table
    SELECT * FROM customers WHERE first_name = ‘Bahaa’;   # selecting a specific customer 
    SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY last_name;  # sorting order of all the data by last name
    SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY last_name DESC; # sorting last name in desc order
    SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY last_name ASC; # sorting last name in ascending order
    SELECT city FROM customers;  	# getting all cities
    SELECT DISTINCT city FROM customers;   # by adding ‘DISTINCT’, we remove duplicates

10.	Selecting from a table (numbers)
    a.	SELECT * FROM customers WHERE age < 30;	
    b.	Wanting customers age between 22 and 40 (using BETWEEN): 
        SELECT * FROM customers WHERE age BETWEEN 22 AND 40;
    c.	Using LIKE: 
        SELECT * FROM customers WHERE city LIKE ‘%C%’; #‘%’ means anything before and after c 
    d.	Using NOT LIKE:
        SELECT * FROM customers WHERE city NOT LIKE ‘%C%’;  # anything that doesn’t have c 
    e.	Using IN:
        SELECT * FROM customers WHERE town IN (‘Douglas’, ‘Kinsale’);
